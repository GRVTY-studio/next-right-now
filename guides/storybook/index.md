# About Storybook

[Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/?ref=unly-nrn) helps you build an interactive documentation of your UI components.

> Next Right Now [uses Storybook](https://nrn-v2-mst-aptd-at-lcz-sty-storybook.vercel.app/){:target="_blank"} to host its own components.
>
> Each preset has its own dedicated Storybook, with components specific to the preset.
>
> When you use Next Right Now as a boilerplate, you automatically benefit from a default Storybook setup, which was designed to be extended, so you can include your own components.

The documentation about all the Next Right Now React components is done on Storybook.

> At this time, Storybook only has one "production" static site, there is no staging. It didn't seem necessary to make things more complicated, as it's not supposedly to be critical.
