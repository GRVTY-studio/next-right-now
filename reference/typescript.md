## TypeScript Cheat Sheet

We strongly recommend you read through [TypeScript Cheat Sheet](https://react-typescript-cheatsheet.netlify.app/docs/basic/setup), it's such a great piece of work and should help you alongside your TS journey, whether you're experimented or a beginner.

> You don't need to focus on "how to configure" TS, because that's already done by NRN.

Alternatively, see this summary of the most-useful TS official [built-in types](https://github.com/sindresorhus/type-fest#built-in-types) and their examples.

## Type Fest

Next Right Now comes built-in with [`Type Fest`](https://github.com/sindresorhus/type-fest), a set of utilities TS types.

If you feel like you're missing some TS typing capabilities, check those first!
